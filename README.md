# Paste Coordinates into Munzee

## Introduction

This browser extension adds a button to the Munzee "Edit Location" page to paste in one click both the latitude and longitude from a pair of coordinates in the clipboard.

This saves a bit of time when deploying to a virtual garden. You can now select both the latitude and longitude in the garden spreadsheet and copy them in one go, instead of copying one number, flipping back to the sheet, and copying the other number.
